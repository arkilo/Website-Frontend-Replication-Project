# Website replication

So essentially I was given an assignment by my school where I had to replicate the divs from any website of my choosing, but I didn't really understand the point of only replicating the divs and basically ended up replicating the entire website but as it turns out, it was not needed which honestly is just counter intuitive to me, like by CREATING an entire site as it was, I have essentially shown that I understand how divs work but no man, school is dumb.

Anyway I thought I might just upload it here.
e that you need without breaking the library.
